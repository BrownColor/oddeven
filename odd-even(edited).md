ODD EVEN ODD


Now-a-days, our national capital Delhi is following the mantra of odd-even rule. These little, but no so immaterial, mathematics concepts were always in there comfort zone of friendly and cosy walls of schools.
Now they are for the first time, at least in India, they are helping delhi-ites on their endeavour of finding the lost breeze of fresh air once used to blow, in this city.
 
.Yes, maybe it's just for 15 days but the chaos on the crowded thoroughfares of the city is being positively affected. Let’s have a closer look into this odd even vehicle rule, the Delhi government has proposed rule to run vehicles with odd and even numbers on alternate days incurred much flak from social media users soon after being announced on December 4. But despite all that, the system was implemented in Delhi from January 1, 2016.

What exactly is the odd-even vehicle rule?
The AAP cabinet announced private vehicles will be allowed to run across the city based on their registration numbers. For example, if a vehicle's registration number ends with an odd 	digit, it will be allowed on the road on January 1, while that ending with an even number can be driven on the second, and so on.

Where did it come from?
This system was implemented in Beijing in 2008 just before the summer Olympics. While the rule was initially said to be temporary, it turned out to be so effective the government made it permanent. The method, more commonly known as road space rationing. Similar road-rationing rules are imposed in many places around the world like Paris, Mexico and Bogota to curb road jams and pollution.

Why is it being enforced?
The Delhi High Court directed the Centre and State governments to come up with comprehensive action plans to put a check on the capital city's "alarming" pollution rate, saying living in Delhi is like "living in a gas chamber".
A day after this, the Kejriwal-led government declared the odd-even vehicle rule with the hope it would lower the number of vehicles hitting the road per day, eventually bringing down the city's air pollution rate.

The few things which should be minded are:

1. Private vehicles with odd registration numbers will be allowed on the road on Mondays, 	           Wednesdays and Fridays.
2. Vehicles with even numbers will run on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. Nothing has been finalised about Sundays yet.
3. This rule is not meant for emergency vehicles such as PCR vans, fire tenders and ambulances, and on public transports like CNG-driven buses, taxis and auto-rickshaws.
4. The government has decided to exempt two-wheelers from this rule.
5. This system, therefore, will be applicable only on private-owned four wheelers running across Delhi, and on those coming in from other states. And that includes vehicles 	used by ministers and bureaucrats of all ranks.
6. The government has added the public transport will be strengthened from the first of January. This will include increasing the frequency of metro trains across the city.
7. Trucks will not be allowed to run across Delhi until 11pm.
8. All vehicles will have to follow the standards of Euro VI 2017.
9. The Delhi government has also decided to shut down the Badarpur power plant in southern Delhi, which is one of the coal-based plants of the NTPC.
10. The government also announced a slew of other measures that could help curb air pollution, including stopping roadside parking to battle congestion, an improving the public transportation system and bringing cleaner fuel to the city before the rest of the country.

In November and early December the city’s air quality slumped to hazardous levels, with levels 	of PM2.5 pollutants, the very fine particles that get lodged inside the lungs and cause the 	most damage, soaring to 12 times above WHO’s safety level of 25 micrograms per cubic meter.
The city has been blanketed in grey smog, and while there is no reliable data on respiratory diseases, most doctors in the capital report a sharp spike in pollution-related illness during the winter months.
Sunita Narain, director of The Centre for Science and Environment, a Delhi-based research and advocacy group, said the government had responded “to a public health emergency.”

The Delhi government Monday decided to levy a fine of Rs 2,000 on vehicles found flouting the odd-even rule that will be in effect between January 1 and 15.
In a meeting chaired by Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia, the government also discussed the categories that could be exempted from the rule. Cars with four persons travelling in them are 	likely be exempted.
“Car-pooling will reduce the load of providing additional public transport and would also mean lesser vehicles on road,” said a source. However, the source added that families will not be 	exempted.
Women drivers with women co-passengers are also being considered in the exemption category. “Only those cars that have women passengers will be exempted. It becomes mentally exhausting for women accustomed to private cars to travel via public transport. Running behind buses and 	the threat of eve-teasing would act as a deterrent for them to use public transport. But women drivers who offer lifts to their male colleagues will not be exempted from the rule,” added the sources.

The dwindling in the amount of pollution made them suggest to continue this 15 day instinct 	more. Amid reports that the odd-even scheme may be extended, Delhi Transport Minister Gopal Rai asserted that the government has no intention to take the road-rationing experiment beyond January 15.

He further said the traffic-restriction is just only for 15 days and after the trial period, government will study the data collected through it and will do a proper analysis, adding, it will then be able to take a final decision.

Rai, who today at his residence held a meeting of Coordination Committee with officials concerned on the scheme, said from January 1-8, traffic police, transport and revenue departments have issued 5,893 challans for the violation of odd-even rules so far.

"Out of these numbers, 2,912 challans were issued by SDMs and 2,260 by traffic police. Besides, enforcement wing of the transport department has issued 721 challans for violating odd-even 	rules so far," he said.

Apart from this, 1,943 challans were issued by the transport department to auto drivers for different violations including refusal to drive.

The government has also received 13,528 calls on its two helplines in the last one week and most of them were related to queries about the scheme. Out of these calls, 395 were related to complaints against bus, auto drivers, and other issues.

According to the minister, in view of traffic rush on some road stretches during peak hours, government has decided to deploy additional teams of transport department and traffic police to manage traffic there from Monday. The areas include, ITO, Ring Road, Outer Ring Road, Connaught Place, Mathura Road, Ashram, New Friends Colony, Nehru Place, Sarai Kale Khan, Hanuman Mandir Marg and Dhaula Kuan.

"Government has also decided to do a close monitoring on the assigned works of civil defence volunteers. Teams of SDM have also formed in this regard," he said.

The fate of the odd-even vehicle scheme will be decided on January 11 by the Delhi High Court which had yesterday reserved its order on various pleas challenging the AAP government's ambitious pilot project which will continue till then.

People one have their own perceptions for this situation, some like this solution but there are fraction of people who are not going well with it. But surely it lowered the content of pollution in the air of Delhi. Now let’s see the call of our government.
